# Tutorial 1: Introduction to Machine Learning with Python

The goal of this tutorial is to introduce a typical workflow in carrying out ML in R.  Similarly to last week's Python tutorial, this includes:

1. accessing and organising data,
2. assessing the data,
3. visualising the data,
4.  a) creating training, b) test datasets and c) learning a model using them and evaluating its performance.


# 1) Load Data

We load the same iris dataset as last week, which has 150 samples and 4 attributes. There are 3 classes (species).

In R we can load the Iris dataset from the `datasets` package:

```{r message=FALSE}
# Load the iris dataset
library(datasets)
data(iris)
iris$Species <- as.character(iris$Species)
```

# 2) Statistics of the dataset

Now compute the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum of each attribute.

Suggestion: use the the `group_by` and `summarise_all` functions from the `dplyr` library.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

# Calculate the mean of each attribute

# Calculate the standard deviation of each attribute

# Calculate the minimum of each attribute

# Calculate the maximum of each attribute

```

# 3) Visualise the dataset

Make some exploratory plots here.

Suggestion: use the `ggplot2` library. For a nice pairs plot use the `ggpairs` function from `GGally` (a `ggplot2` extension library).

```{r message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
```

# 4) Classification using Least Squares

Here we will be carrying out classification using the least squares formulation on 2 classes of the dataset.

### a) Create separate datasets for the classes `setosa` and `versicolor`.

```{r}
# your code here

# result should be two dataframes (one for each for setosa, versicolor classes),
# each with dim (50,5) - 4 attributes plus column for class
stopifnot(all(dim(setosa)==c(50,5)))
stopifnot(all(dim(versicolor)==c(50,5)))
```


### b) add a column to each dataset where the column is $1$ if the class is `setosa` and $-1$ otherwise.

```{r}
# your code here

# result should add a column to each of setosa and versicolor
stopifnot(all(dim(setosa)==c(50,6)))
stopifnot(all(dim(versicolor)==c(50,6)))
```


### c) create training and test datasets, with 20% of the data for testing. This 80 training points and 20 testing points in total (half this per class).

```{r}
# your code here

# resulting dataframes (one each for training and test data) should have
# the appropriate sizes
stopifnot(all(dim(training.data)==c(80,6)))
stopifnot(all(dim(test.data)==c(20,6)))
```



### d) apply the least squares solution to obtain an optimal solution for different combinations of the 4 available attributes. The code to create a list containing all the combinations of the attributes has been provided.

```{r}
# Creates all possible combinations of attributes
# attribute.combinations is a list whose elements are lists of attributes
attribute.names <- colnames(iris)[1:4]
attribute.combinations <- do.call(
  c,
  lapply(1:4, function(i) as.list(data.frame(combn(attribute.names, i))))
  )
names(attribute.combinations) <- 1:length(attribute.combinations)


return.predictions <- function(attribute.names, training.data, test.data) {
  
  # Format training and test data (as matrices)
  ### your code here

  # Calculate optimal weights
  ### your code here
  
  # Make predictions
  ### your code here

  return(predictions)
}
```



### e) evaluate which input attributes are the best.

```{r}
# Calculate the mean square error between some predictions and
# the corresponding testing data
return.mse <- function(predictions, testing.data) {
  ### your code here
  return(mse)
}

# Calculate the test MSE for each the elements of attribute.combinations
# by calling return.predictions and return.mse
```
